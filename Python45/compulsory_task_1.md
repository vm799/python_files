What is normalisation?

Normalisation is a way of trying to correct for errors or inconsistencies in data
by assessing and correcting table structures. It is also responsible for eliminating errors and anomalies.
This allows the database to be in a 'consistent state' by using normalisation as a technique to design the database.

When is a table in 1NF?
A table is in First Normal Form rules if each cell in the table has one single value with no repeating groups and all attributes are dependant on a primary key.

When is a table in 2NF?
A table is in Second Normal Form rules if it is already in 1NF and then have appropriate primary keys that will identify an attribute value that is not dependant on  any other data subset. The data should therefore be uniquely identifiable by it's primary key and has no partial dependencies.


When is a table in 3NF?
A table is in Third Normal Form rules if it is already in 1NF and 2NF.
In 3NF the table has no 'transitive functional dependencies' which means that 
there are indirect relationaships between the data to cause a functional dependancy.
