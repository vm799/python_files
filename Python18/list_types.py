# Part 1:
# write a program to store the names of 3 friends as strings
# create a variable called friends_names to store the names in
# print out the name of first and last names and the length of the list
# sought help from https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-string-formatters-in-python-3

# PART 2: 
# create a variable called friends_ages 
# this should hold the age info for eeach friend

friends_name = ["Caroline", "Chetan", "Jo"]


print(friends_name[0]) #first friend index
print(friends_name[-1])  #last friend
print(len(friends_name)) #length of list

# linked all 3 required staetments together
print("My friend's list begins with {} and ends with {} and is {} long.".format("Caroline", "Jo", 3))

# as requested corresponding ages of the friends named in other list
friends_ages =["46", "36", "26"]
friends_name = ["Caroline", "Chetan", "Jo"]

# nothing further requested of this list
