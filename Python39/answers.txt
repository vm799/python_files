Question 4:
A stateless protocol is a communication set of rules/protocol in which the user that receives 
the data must not remember or keep the previous session state.
The communication must be dealt with as an independant event and in no way related 
to the previous event or any similar event.
Protocols like IP or Internet Protocol are stateless and don't keep track of information for
multiple communications.
Every HTTP request is stateless, independant and detached from the request before it.
